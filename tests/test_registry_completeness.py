"""Registry-completeness contract — every primary exporter has at least
one ModelEntry in `reflex.registry.data.REGISTRY`.

The bug this catches: customer reports 2026-05-10 found GR00T + OpenVLA
exporters had shipped without registry entries → `reflex models list`,
`reflex chat`, and `reflex doctor` all said "not supported" even though
the underlying export pipelines worked. README claimed support; CLI
discovery surface didn't know.

Without this test, every future exporter shipped to `src/reflex/exporters/`
silently regresses the discovery surface. Anyone running `reflex models
list` won't see the new model.

Internal-only exporters (helpers consumed by other exporters, not
directly customer-facing) are exempt via the EXPORTERS_INTERNAL set.
Adding to the exempt list requires a docstring justification per the
"explicit exemption" pattern.
